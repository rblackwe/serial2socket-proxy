Also you can use this socket connection for communicate with your arduino board from Flash/Air application programmed in Actionscript, a PHP application or whatever language that can access to a socket. Here is [other existing serial to net solutions] (http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Interfacing/SerialNet)
