serial2socket-proxy
===================

Description
-----------

serial2socket-proxy is a cross-platform software application developed in Processing for creating a virtual connection between the serial port and a network socket port. 

For example, you can control an Arduino board connected to the serial port from any computer over internet. Also you can use this socket connection for communicate with your arduino board from Flash/Air application programmed in Actionscript, a PHP application or whatever language that can access to a socket. Here is [other existing serial to net solutions] (http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Interfacing/SerialNet)
